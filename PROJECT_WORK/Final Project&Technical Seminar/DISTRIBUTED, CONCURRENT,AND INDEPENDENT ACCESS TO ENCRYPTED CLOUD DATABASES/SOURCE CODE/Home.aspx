Placing critical data in the hands of a cloud provider should come with the guarantee of security and availability for data at
rest, in motion, and in use. Several alternatives exist for storage services, while data confidentiality solutions for the database as a
service paradigm are still immature. We propose a novel architecture that integrates cloud database services with data confidentiality
and the possibility of executing concurrent operations on encrypted data. This is the first solution supporting geographically distributed
clients to connect directly to an encrypted cloud database, and to execute concurrent and independent operations including those
modifying the database structure. The proposed architecture has the further advantage of eliminating intermediate proxies that limit the
elasticity, availability, and scalability properties that are intrinsic in cloud-based solutions. The efficacy of the proposed architecture is
evaluated through theoretical analyses and extensive experimental results based on a prototype implementation subject to the TPC-C
standard benchmark for different numbers of clients and network latencies.
